/*
The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms.
eg :- Let's consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A lady behaves like a teacher in a classroom, 
mother or daughter in a home and customer in a market. 
Here, a single person is behaving differently according to the situations.
