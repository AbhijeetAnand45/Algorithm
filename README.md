## Theory
  > An algorithm can be defined as a finite set of steps, which has to be followed while carrying out a particular problem. It is nothing but a process of executing actions step by step.

### Advantages of an Algorithm

- **Effective Communication**:
    > Since it is written in a natural language like English, it becomes easy to understand the step-by-step delineation of a solution to any particular problem.
- **Easy Debugging**: 
    > A well-designed algorithm facilitates easy debugging to detect the logical errors that occurred inside the program.
- **Easy and Efficient Coding**:
    > An algorithm is nothing but a blueprint of a program that helps develop a program.
- **Independent of Programming Language**: 
    > Since it is a language-independent, it can be easily coded by incorporating any high-level language.

### Disadvantages of an Algorithm
- Developing algorithms for complex problems would be time-consuming and difficult to understand.
- It is a challenging task to understand complex logic through algorithms.

### Pseudocode
- Pseudocode refers to an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. - It uses structural conventions of a standard programming language intended for human reading rather than the machine reading.

### Advantages of Pseudocode
- Since it is similar to a programming language, it can be quickly transformed into the actual programming language than flowchart.
- The layman can easily understand it.
- Easily modifiable as compared to the flowcharts.
- Its implementation is beneficial for structured, designed elements.
- It can easily detect an error before transforming it into a code.
- Disadvantages of Pseudocode
- Since it does not incorporate any standardized style or format, it can vary from one company to another.
- Error possibility is higher while transforming into a code.
- It may require a tool for extracting out the Pseudocode and facilitate drawing flowcharts.
- It does not depict the design.


### Difference 
- Pseudo Approach:
    1. Initialize a variable called as Count to zero, absent to zero, total to 60
    2. FOR EACH Student PRESENT DO the following:
         - Increase the Count by One
    3. Then Subtract Count from total and store the result in absent
    4. Display the number of absent students
- Algorithmic Approach:
    1. Count <- 0, absent <- 0, total <- 60
    2. REPEAT till all students counted
         - Count <- Count + 1
    3. absent <- total - Count
    4. Print "Number absent is:" , absent
