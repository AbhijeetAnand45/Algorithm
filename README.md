# Algorithm

This repo is all about the implementation of various algorithms.

Devide and conquer algorithm in selection problem to find kth smallest value.

It includes Greedy algorithm problems such as knapsack problem .

while it also includes dynamic programming approches such as the problems related to knapsack 0/1 implementation , matrix chain multiplication.
